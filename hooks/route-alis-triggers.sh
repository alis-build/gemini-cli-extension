# BeforeAgent hook: keep the Alis Build routing contract in front of the model
# once the user has engaged Alis, and load the Define->Build->Deploy primer on
# the engaging turn.
#
# BeforeAgent is Gemini CLI's user-prompt-submit event: it fires after the user
# submits a prompt and before agent planning. The payload (JSON on stdin)
# carries the prompt text in `.prompt` and the session in `.session_id`.
#
# Why "sticky": a hook injects per-turn, not as a standing instruction, so a
# routing contract injected once on "alis, ..." goes stale and later build/fix
# requests (often phrased without any trigger word, e.g. "could you help adding
# tracing?") get treated as plain coding tasks. So:
#
#   * vocative "alis" (e.g. "alis, ...", "ask alis to ...") -> inject the DBD
#     primer AND the full routing contract, and mark this session as
#     Alis-engaged.
#   * any later turn in an Alis-engaged session -> inject a terse one-block
#     reminder only (the full contract was already provided on the engaging
#     turn), so the router stays live without repeating the whole block or the
#     primer every turn.
#   * sessions where the user never addressed Alis -> inject nothing.
#
# The routing reminder is self-scoping (it only activates the router for
# build/fix-shaped Alis Build requests), and reinforces GEMINI.md's standing
# rule. Not gated on an ~/alis.build workspace.
#
# Unlike Claude Code / Codex (which append a hook's raw stdout to context),
# Gemini CLI requires the only stdout to be a single JSON object. The context is
# therefore delivered via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext.

<alis-routing>
Alis Build routing contract — the user has engaged Alis this session. Keep this
in mind for this and the following turns:

- "build it" / "fix it", or any request to build, fix, add, or change something
  on the Alis Build platform — including naturally phrased asks like "could you
  help add X to my server?" — → treat as a ROUTER, not a direct task. Work out
  the intended outcome (ask ONE concise question only if it is genuinely
  ambiguous), then call the Alis Build MCP `SearchSkills` tool FIRST with that
  outcome as the query (fall back to `ListSkills` if it returns nothing). Present
  the matching skills (id, what each does, when to choose it), ask which to use,
  and only then call `LoadSkill` and follow that skill's workflow — the loaded
  skill owns execution. Do NOT inspect, write, or edit code, run
  Define / Build / Deploy, or make commits before a skill is loaded. If no skill
  fits, say so and offer `RequestSkill`.

- "spec it" / "spec it up", or a request to turn the current session into a build
  specification → call the `SpecIt` tool DIRECTLY. Do NOT route this through
  SearchSkills. It needs no arguments (session context is resolved server-side);
  pass `build_spec` only when the user names an existing one to append to. Report
  the returned BuildSpec back to the user.
